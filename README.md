# Data-Visualization-World-Population-Task-1-
🔹 Objective

The goal of this task was to create visualizations to understand the distribution of data using bar charts and histograms. The dataset used contains world population data, and the focus was on exploring population patterns across countries.

🔹 Work Done

In this task, I performed the following steps:

Loaded and explored the population dataset using Pandas

Created a histogram to visualize the distribution of country populations

Built a bar chart showing the Top 10 most populated countries (2020)

Added proper labels, titles, and formatting for clear interpretation

🔹 Key Insights

Most countries have small to medium populations

A few countries (like China and India) have extremely large populations, causing a right-skewed distribution

There is a large population gap between the top two countries and the rest of the world

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Outcome

This task helped me understand how data visualization can be used to identify trends, patterns, and distributions in real-world datasets. It strengthened my skills in data handling and graphical representation of data.
